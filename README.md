# Mobile Chat App

## Objective

The objective of this project is to build a chat app for mobile devices using React Native. The app provides users with a chat interface and options to share images and their location.

## Context

As mobile usage increases, more people are using their phones for daily tasks. This includes shopping, creating to-do lists, communicating with friends, scheduling meetings, and more. This project leverages React Native, a framework for building Android and iOS apps with a single codebase, to create a chat app that can be added to a portfolio and demonstrate knowledge of JavaScript mobile development.
